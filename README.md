# Rails-React-Auth

This app is in the work. I'm using it to practice on React and React Native client apps. This app is still in the work, but it has a complete Auth system that is ready to be used against client apps.
Once you register from the client app you will receive an access_token. There is also a verify_access_token in the Session controller method so you can use it to verify the access_tokens.
